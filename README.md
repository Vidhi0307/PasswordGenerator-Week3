## Description

This project is the solution for the Bootcamp week 3 Challenge .The objective was to create a random password generator.We were given basic code with html ,css files already written.We were required modify the javascript file for implementing the additional functionalities.
-I have tried my best to modify the code using the js skills and knowledge that I gained in the third week.
-the  code has been implemented to use  logical algorithms to render the desired requirments.Multiples window prompts to accept users inputs are created.Also the inputs are then validated and processed.
-I am happy that I was able to actually apply the skills, it gave me more clarity and confidence about the knowledge.



## Installation

-A public link has been created for the website which requires any web browser.


## Usage

The code renders to a webpage for generating a random password based on the requirements provided by users.
-The generate password button will open a series of window prompts asking different questions regarding customes's requirmentsfor the password.
-cx needs to answer what character types they want to include in the password ,the lenth of the password.
-Javascript has been coded to accept ,validate and process customer's input.
-Note: Only the javascript file  has been modified to make the code user responsive.
